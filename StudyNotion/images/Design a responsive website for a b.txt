Design a responsive website for a business theme(e.g.,Cafe,bookstore,or fitness centre) that includes the following pages like:
Home,About,Services,Doorstep support and contact....
Create a mock-up for each page, ensuring the design adapts to different screen sizes(desktop,tablet, and mobile).
Justify your design choices, including layout, colour scheme and typograpy, and  explain how they enhance user experience(UX) across devices.

Deliverables:

Mock-ups the responsive design parameters for all pages
a written explanation of design choices.
a brief report on how the design addresses responsiveness.
the navbar must stick to the top when the user scrolls down the page at a screen size 1200px.
on smaller screens(below 768px), the menu should collapse into  hamburger icon.
the logo should shrink by 50% on elegant layout.
Ensure the usage of two-column footer, on the webpage and webpages are browser independent.
